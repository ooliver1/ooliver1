# ooliver1

Hey there, I'm Oliver, an 19 year old software developer from the UK. I love making backend applications in Python, Typescript, Rust and Java/Kotlin, and contributing to other OSS projects whilst sometimes bearing a bit of web development.

I am currently working on [a fully typehinted and intuitive Lavalink wrapper for Python](https://github.com/ooliver1/mafic)
